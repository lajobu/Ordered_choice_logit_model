## :star: Description:

In our study we used `data collected by Stack Overflow` during the `annual survey in 2018` designed for programmers. Stack Overflow is a community forum for programmers. In this forum the users are able to ask questions about their programs, and one is able to reply to them sharing his knowledge.

We will verify the following `hypothesis` using `ordered choices logit model`:

`Hypothesis 1: Higher salary increases career satisfaction`

In our study we will examine the `relationship between salary and career satisfaction`. During the career, a person changes the job from one company to another when there is a better offer. Biggest part of the offer is salary levels. When a person is satisfied with the salary, stays in the company longer and claims that she has a higher level of career satisfaction.

`Hypothesis 2: Having hobby increases career satisfaction`

We will `describe the relationship between having hobby and career satisfaction`. We think the people with hobbies are more satisfied with their career and find time to express themselves by having hobbies. Also, people who do not have hobbies are more concerned first to reach career satisfaction and then take some time for hobbies.
